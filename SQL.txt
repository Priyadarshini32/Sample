JOINS

INNER JOIN:

Syntax:

SELECT columns
FROM table1
INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.column = table2.column;

Description: Returns rows when there is a match in both tables based on the join condition.

LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN):

Syntax:

SELECT columns
FROM table1
LEFT JOIN table2 ON table1.column = table2.column;

Description: Returns all rows from the left table (table1), and the matched rows from the right table (table2). If there's no match, NULL values are returned for the right table columns.

RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN):

Syntax:

SELECT columns
FROM table1
RIGHT JOIN table2 ON table1.column = table2.column;

Description: Returns all rows from the right table (table2), and the matched rows from the left table (table1). If there's no match, NULL values are returned for the left table columns.

FULL JOIN (or FULL OUTER JOIN):

Syntax:

SELECT columns
FROM table1
FULL JOIN table2 ON table1.column = table2.column;

Description: Returns all rows when there is a match in either table (table1 or table2). When there is no match, NULL values are returned for the columns of the table that lacks a matching row in the other table.

CROSS JOIN:

Syntax:

SELECT columns
FROM table1
CROSS JOIN table2;

Description: Returns the Cartesian product of the two tables, i.e., all possible combinations of rows from both tables. No join condition is required.
